i'm currently making a 3D game with unreal engine.




The synopsis of the game will be that: 
you're an engineer that land on a planet after detecting a distress signal from the planet, upon arriving on the planet his ship is somehow deactivated until he find and stop the signal. the signal come from a strange structure that the player begin to explore only to find an abandoned lab with a blackhole inside, he then listen to a video recording of someone explaining that this was a civilization composed of aliens at first and after years of technological evolution they created robots to help them, their technological evolution caused tons of pollution which they found the best way to get rid of is by sending them away in the blackhole. the blackhole is stabilized for now but Something weird happened that caused the whole civilisation to be teleported inside and trapped, your goal is to use the ressources on the planet to develop a way to help the aliens get out of the void, while still being extra ecological to avoid another issue with the blackhole. the robots are mostly destroyed but you'll be able to fix them tier by tier across the duration of the game (exemple: you'll first need circuits to reactivate their logical processors, then steel and rotor to enable them to use their arms again etc..)  the game will have limited procedural terrain generation, there will






ideas:
gas mask for sulfur deposit which will damage the player 
sulfur will be needed to repair the robots further, when the tier of upgrade is achieved robot will take damage overtime but way less than the player so there will be a way to automate it

stop time
mineral poisoning






list of element:
sulfur
cotton
flex
carrot like vegetable
clay deposits
stone
aluminum -> papier alu 
tin -> du thÃ© vert au tin 
lead 
uranium -> recreate marie curie
copper -> copper ingots -> copper wires
			-> copper PLAQUES 
lithium ore -> lithium -> 
iron ore -> iron ingots -> iron plates 
			-> iron gears
			-> scraps
coal ore -> coal -> powdered coal
		 -> Graphite
		 -> iron ingots + powdered coal -> steel







planet name+ ium
